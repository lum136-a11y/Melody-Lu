            <div>Yesterday, I searched time management online and discovered a video that
            I found really helpful. It didn't recommend specific tools or techniques, 
            but has pointed out that the key point for an effective time management is 
            to focus on what's importnat.</div>
            <img id="myImage" src="imgs/Most important.jpg" alt="An Image Indicating the Complete Outline of a Cartoon Bear">
            <img id="myImage2" src="imgs/Less important.jpg" alt="An Image Indicating Partial Outline of the Cartoon Bear, After the Bottom Was Clicked">
            <div class="Btm">Click</div>
            <div>Using the two images above as an example, the most important thing represent OUTLINE
                of an object; the less important thing represent DETAIL. If the most important 
                thing is resolved prior to details, the entire plan will be more complete, which will
                ease the process later on and make the steps more effective.
            </div>
        </article>
        
        <article><div>Besides the level of importance, the other thing that makes an effective
            time management is urgency. I've encountered some situation that there're two 
            equally important things happened simultaneously, which made me concern about 
            the heavy workload.</div>
        <img class= "pickbox" src="imgs/urgent.jpg" alt="A Venn Diagram Indicating the Priority of the Most Important and Urgent Thing ">
            <div>To evaluate the priority of the important things, the urgency level should also 
                be considered. According to the graph above, the most important and urgent thing 
                should be resolved first.
