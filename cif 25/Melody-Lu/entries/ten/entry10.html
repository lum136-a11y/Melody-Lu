    <h1>Pros & Cons</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
        As the progress of this project was interrupted because of hospitalization, <br>
        I was unable to complete the project effectively, and I realized there were <br>
        many points I still needed to improve. This entry is going to provide a balanced <br>
        view on the pros and cons I encountered from my experience. How the project <br>
        affected my learning and some challenges I faced. </p>
