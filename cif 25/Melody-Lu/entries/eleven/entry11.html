            <h1>My Next Steps</h1>
            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>For my next step, I decide to give up any expectation for my future.
                I learned that there're too many things that I can't control in life, 
                such as the hospitalization that happened to me in week 10.
            </p></div>

            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>What am I going to do? I have no idea. However, I want to connect
                more with my parents as I realized that they're in the stage of needing
                connection from children and beginning to age.
            </p></div>
        </article>
        <article>
            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>Something I'd like to talk to myself, a youth who's panic about the future,
                is to take one step at a time. Don't rush into the future, because no one 
                know what's going to happen next.
            </p></div>
            
            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>There are five goals I want to achieve in the next
                five years. The first thing is to avoid engaging in serious arguments
                with others. While at the same time, don't bear the negative emotions.</p></div>

            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>Second, maintaining regular exercise. I was suggested by the doctor
                in Taiwan to do moderate exercise for at least 30 minutes two to 
                three times a week. 
            </p></div>

            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>Third, managing time and funds I own right now. Trying not to get 
                overwhelm by the things I can't control, or being anxious about
                financial status.
            </p></div>
            
            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>Fourth, graduate from the New School, and find a job that I'm interested in.
                (try not to fail any classes)
            </p></div>

            <div class="flex-container">  <div class="vertical-line"></div>
            <p>Lastly, becoming a comic creator.</p></div>
