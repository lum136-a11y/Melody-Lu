    <h1>Activity Pattern</h1>
    <h3>My Objective of This Project</h3>
      <p>In my harmonic collection project, I'm going to explore my activity pattern
        to help me develop a better time management skill. 
        The goal I have for this project is to find out which activities I have spent time on the most objectively, looking for the reason 
        why certain kinds of activities took long and what improvement I could implemented to have a balance between each activity 
        and my daily life.   </p>
