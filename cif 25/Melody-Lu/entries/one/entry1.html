      <h1>Activity Pattern</h1>
      <h3>My Objective of This Project</h3>
      <p>In my harmonic collection project, I'm going to explore my activity pattern
        to help me develop a better time management skill. <br>
        The goal I have for this project is to find out which activities I have spent time on the most objectively, looking for the reason <br>
        why certain kinds of activities took long and what improvement I could implemented to have a balance between each activity <br>
        and my daily life. </p>
