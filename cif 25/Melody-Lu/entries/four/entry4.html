            <br>
             <p>The activities I encounter in my daily life can be devided into four categories: <br>
                Random activity, class time, daily routine, and habit. In the long-term (weekly) <br>
                pattern, random activity occupies the largest proportion, taking up 49.4% of time <br>
                in a week. Class time and daily routine share the similar proportion (each share <br>
                19.3% and 20.6%), taking up about 2/5 of the day. Habit, such as using phone, has <br>
                the smallest proportion, which takes up 10.7%, about 1/5 of time in a week. <br><br>
            <span>The daily pattern, likewise, have the similar arrangement as the weekly pattern. <br>
                 From the example of Sep 18, random activity have a more significant difference <br>
                 compared to daily routine and class time. The difference between habit is not significant. <br>

         <p>Before doing the activity tracking, I thought 
            the activity that take up the most in my daily life were 
            daily routine and phone, which often frustrated me as I thought 
            my time in the past were wasted a lot on something meaningless. 
            However, after looking closely on what I was actually doing, 
            I found that it was rather I lacks a specific goal and plan for 
            my time arragement, that caused the time I spent on each activity 
            extended and became unproductive. This situation can be blamed on 
            my own personality as being sluggish and overly cautious during making 
            process, further influencing my mood and taking more time for me to 
            get back into regular emotional state. 
         </p> 
    </div>

     <p>There are some problem I've discovered <br>
        <ul><li>Lack of specific goal and management</li>
                <li>Overly cautious; Thinks a lot, does a little</li>
                <li>Not proficient on skills-based tasks</li>
                <li>Feels like "I'm not ready" to do tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <div>
        Being overly cautious and skill issues caused myself to overthink and did less; <br>
        Lack of specific goals and feeling of "not ready" reduce motivation and attentio <br>
        n neccessiated to work on the task consistenetly. All of them can result in <br>
        unproductive working process, creating stress and fatigues that make the time <br>
         management even worse.
    </div> <br>
        
        <div>I've come up with some solutions in regard of the four problems <br>
            I've obscured with. <br>
            <ol>
            <li>Not sure about how to find goal. It does takes time, but <br>
                    I can probably ask my oldest sister (graduate), consult advisor <br>
                    seeking school events that introduces graphid design field. <br>
                    Before having a huge goal of my career choice, I can probably <br>
                    start with some small goal, like "I want to be/do something... <br></li>
            <li>Objectifying the design process. Having a clear blue-print in mind <br>
                    before constructing the piece. Assume a project takes up a week to <br>
                    finish, taking the first 1 to 2 day to think and make a blue-print, <br>
                    reducing and retaining the most important elements. Taking baby steps <br>
                    and give myslef break. <br></li>
