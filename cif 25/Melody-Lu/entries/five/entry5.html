        <div><h1>Assign More Time</h1></div>
        <div>The advices I received have helped me implent a better mindset, 
        making me more "ready" to start the assignment. Also, I realized that 
        if I want to focus on details, I have to assign more time for myself. 
        I felt more motivated when I keep this idea in mind.</div>

                <li>The Solution last week <br> was too complicated</li>
                <li>I didn't know how to start; <br>It took more time instead</li>
                <li>I got panic when the activity spent <br> more time than I had expected.</li>
                <li>Still took lots of time on <br>skill-based issues</li>
        </ol>

            <h4>Improvement</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>I consulted the ULC, they provided <br>some strategies for time management <br>
                   - Starting with simple, thinking about <br>process reduction<br>
              </li>
              <li>From typo lecture professor: <br>"Starting with bad idea"</li>
        </ol> </div>
    </div>

       <h3>What's The Main Point That Time Management Isn't Effective?</h3>
       <h2>-- Consider How Much Time Is Actually Needed</h2>
       <p class="mobile">As I got the feedback from ULC, I learned that it was impossible to multitask <br>
       -- which I misunderstood as "having a good time-management." A better<br>
        time management involves a careful consideration of how much time is acutally <br>
         needed, according to the situation and individual condition. For example, <br>
         I often stressed when I rushed to finish the assignment in a limited time. <br>
         To avoid this, I should assign more time for myself, so I can concentrate more.
       </p>
       
        <h3> <strong>A More Concrete Step:</strong> </h3>
        <p class="ending">Consider my mental health and current situation, I found that <br>
            the appropriate amount of time assign for work is about <br>
            4 - 6 hours per day. It's also better to have preparation <br>
            before starting the work. It will save more time and avoid <br>
            burnout in the long run.
