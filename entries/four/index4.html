    <h2>The Sun</h2>
    <span class="poem">
        Have you ever seen<br>
        anything<br>
        in your life<br>
        more wonderful<br>
    </span>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">
        than the way the sun,<br>
        every evening,<br>
        relaxed and easy,<br>
        floats toward the horizon<br>
    </span>
        <br>
    <span class="poem">
        and into the clouds or the hills,<br>
        or the rumpled sea,<br>
        and is gone–<br>
        and how it slides again<br>
    </span>
        <br>
    <span class="poem">
        out of the blackness,<br>
        every morning,<br>
        on the other side of the world,<br>
        like a red flower<br>
    </span>
        <br>
    <span>
        streaming upward on its heavenly oils,<br>
        say, on a morning in early summer,<br>
        on the other side of the world,<br>
        and have you ever felt for anything<br>
        such wild love–<br>
        do you think there is anywhere, in any language,<br>
        a word billowing enough<br>
        for the pleasure<br>
    </span>
        <br>
    <span class="poem">
        that fills you,<br>
        as the sun<br>
        reaches out,<br>
        as it warms you<br>
    </span>
        <br>
    <span class="poem">
        as you stand there,<br>
        empty-handed–<br>
        or have you too<br>
        turned from this world–<br>
    </span>
        <br>
    <span class="poem">
        or have you too<br>
        gone crazy<br>
        for power,<br>
        for things?<br>
    </span>
