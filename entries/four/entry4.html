        <p class="Analysis">Analysis: The activities I encounter in my daily life can be devided <br>
            into four categories: Random activity, class time, daily routine, <br>
            and habit. In the long-term (weekly) pattern, random activity <br>
            occupies the largest proportion, taking up 49.4% of time in a week. <br>
            Class time and daily routine share the similar proportion (each share 19.3% and 20.6%), <br>
            taking up about 2/5 of the day. Habit, such as using phone, has the smallest <br>
            proportion, which takes up 10.7%, about 1/5 of time in a week.<br> <br>
            <span>The daily pattern, likewise, have the similar arrangement as <br>
                the weekly pattern. From the example of Sep 18, random activity <br>
                have a more significant difference compared to daily routine and <br>
                class time. The difference between habit is not significant.

    <div class="flex-container">
         <p>Interpretation: According to the pie charts above, <br>
            the large proportion of random activity indicates that <br>
             I spent the most of the time on things that are not <br>
             planned or expected. The numeral difference of random <br>
             also infers that there're many variations involved in. <br>
             Class time and daily routine are repeatitive and more <br>
             predictable, which explains the moderate proportions <br>
             they have taken in. They're relatively stable as they <br>
             take up similar proportions and have minor difference <br>
             in the two charts. Habit have the smallest proportion, <br>
             meaning that I spent the least time on them, and they <br>
             do exist repeatitively. 
         </p>

         <p>Reflection: Before doing the activity tracking, I thought <br>
            the activity that take up the most in my daily life were <br>
            daily routine and phone, which often frustrated me as I thought <br>
            my time in the past were wasted a lot on something meaningless. <br>
            However, after looking closely on what I was actually doing, <br>
            I found that it was rather I lacks a specific goal and plan for <br>
            my time arragement, that caused the time I spent on each activity <br>
            extended and became unproductive. This situation can be blamed on <br>
            my own personality as being sluggish and overly cautious during making <br>
            process, further influencing my mood and taking more time for me to <br>
            get back into regular emotional state. 
         </p>
    </div>

    
     <p class="Distinguish">Distinguish the problem: There are some problem I've discovered <br>
        <ul><li>Lack of specific goal and management</li>
                <li>Overly cautious; Thinks a lot, does a little</li>
                <li>Not proficient on skills-based tasks</li>
                <li>Feels like "I'm not ready" to do tasks</li>
            </ul>
        These are the four main reasons that cuased myself to have excessive <br>
             use of time. Being overly cautious and skill issues caused myself to <br>
             overthink and did less; Lack of specific goals and feeling of "not ready" <br>
             reduce motivation and attention neccessiated to work on the task consistenetly. <br>
             All of them can result in unproductive working process, creating stress <br>
             and fatigues that make the time management even worse. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="Solution">Solution: I've come up with some solutions in regard of the four problems <br>
            I've obscured with. <br>
            <ol class="Solution">
            <li>??? Not sure about how to find goal. It does takes time, but <br>
                    I can probably ask my oldest sister (graduate), consult advisor <br>
                    seeking school events that introduces graphid design field. <br>
                    Before having a huge goal of my career choice, I can probably <br>
                    start with some small goal, like "I want to be/do something... <br></li>
            <li>Objectifying the design process. Having a clear blue-print in mind <br>
                    before constructing the piece. Assume a project takes up a week to <br>
                    finish, taking the first 1 to 2 day to think and make a blue-print, <br>
                    reducing and retaining the most important elements. Taking baby steps <br>
                    and give myslef break. <br></li>  
            <li>There're three solutions for technical issues - self-taught, teachers, <br>
                    and others. Ask questions to teachers or experts outside of schools to <br>
                    resolve the technical problem. Looking for program for certain types <br>
                    of issues (ex, learning center, study group, family with experties) <br>
                    For self-taught, define the problem into four steps => Observation -> <br>
                    Analysis -> Identify problem -> Plan for solution. <br></li>
            <li>Last but not least, Experiment with different clues to make myself "turn on"<br></li>
            </ol>
        </p>
