        <h2>Reflection of the Week</h2>
        <p>Progress Check: <br>
        Reflect ont last week, I thought the solutions I came up with didn't work well. <br>
        One positive thing was that I've figured out the problems of why I had bad time management <br>
        and did tried to improve. The main reason why the solution didn't work was because <br>
        it was too complicated, making me hard to start. Accordingly, I decided to make a <br>
        more concrete and simpler step that allows myself to slow down and have a more <br>
        evident look of progression.

    <p>Problem List Out: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The Solution last week was too complicated</li>
        <li>I didn't know how to start; It took more time instead</li>
        <li>I got panic when the activity spent more time than <br>
            I had expected. - -> Caused stress</li>
        <li>Still took lots of time on skill-based issues</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p>Although some new problem occurred, there were some improvement
        <ol>
            <li>I consulted the ULC, they provided some strategies for time management <br>
                 - Starting with simple, thinking about process reduction<br>
            </li>
            <li>From typo lecture professor: "Starting with bad idea"</li>
        </ol> 
        The advices I received have helped me implent a better mindset, <br>
        making me more "ready" to start the assignment. Also, I realized that <br>
        if I want to focus on details, I have to assign more time for myself. <br>
        I felt more motivated when I keep this idea in mind. 
    </p>

    <p>Analysis: <br>
       <h3>What's The Main Point That The Solution Didn't Work?</h3>
       <h3>-- The Solution Was Not Concrete</h3>
       As I got the feedback from ULC, I learned that it was impossible to multitask <br>
       -- which I misunderstood as "having a good time-management." Indeed, to have <br>
       a better time management involves time reduction, leaving out gaps for other <br>
       neccessary activity. However, everyone have different pace and strategies on their <br>
       working process. I have to make up a solution that adapt to the mode I am most <br>
       comfotable with.
