  <h4>Reflection</h4>

  <p>Based on the data obtained from Septermber 18, 2025, I found that I spent the most time worked on random assignments, 
    which took up 8.3 hours of my day (excluding the sleeping time). <br> It proved that I didn't waste time on doing nothing, 
    rather I spent too much time on particular tasks. The time I spent on those tasks stole time that could be used for other activities.
  </p>

  <p>In addition, I realized that I often sepnt time on somethings that "seems necessary but actually don't." For instance, before working on
    studio project, I often thought I needed to do some research or do something to "prepare" for the upcoming works. However, these tiny activities were 
    unecessary. I could still complete the assignment well without doing those things. 

  <p>The frist day track I took has given me an insight that time span actually means a lot even though it only lasted a little. 
    I often heard people said "it's just take 1 to 2 hours, you're gonna take it easy." However, <br> if we remove the time for sleep, 1 hour has taken 
    the proportion of 1/16 of the day. It was not a time period as simple as people consider. 
  </p>

  <p>According to the activity pattern on Septermber 18, I've come up with some tips to help me to improve my time managemen. For things that "seems neccessary but not",
     I decided to rearrange my schedule and set a specific time period for them. For example, prepare what I will wear tomorrow before going to bed, so that I won't waste time
     picking clothes in the mortning. For overworking on class assignments, divided the task into smaller parts, distribute them into different days, and set up time limit 
     for each task.

  <h4>My Next Step</h4>

  <p>Each day may have variables that will influence the activity pattern (like accident, emergency). To restrict those variables, 
    I decided to track my activity pattern for a week to get a more stable pattern. The weekend generally have different form from the work days, so I'll 
    isolate them into different entries.
